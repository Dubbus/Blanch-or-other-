# Blanch

Beauty color analysis & product discovery iOS app. Users go through a two-stage draping quiz (factual questions + A/B lip renders on their own selfie), land on a color season with an explainer, and get matched makeup products + influencer lip combos.

## Project Origin

Conceived from a conversation with makeup influencer Sydney. See `/Users/muralihome/Documents/Adarsh/Professional Development/Project Notes/Sydney Makeup App Concepts.md` for the original concept notes.

### Pivot — pure CV → hybrid quiz + draping (2026-04)
Sydney's follow-up feedback flagged two problems with the pure-CV analysis pipeline: (1) lighting variables make selfies unreliable (even outdoor sun photos trend warm), and (2) users find "which shade pops?" questions obtuse. Response: keep the CV pipeline as a silent prior, but drive the result through a **two-stage questionnaire** that differentiates Blanch from competitors like Colorwise.me.

Key differentiation vs. Colorwise:
- **Product-first output** — we output actual shoppable lipsticks (2,326 products), not just a palette.
- **Negative selection** — Stage 2 asks "which makes you look tired?" instead of "which do you like?" — faster and more confident.
- **Lip draping on the user's own face** — Colorwise drapes fabric; we render lipstick onto the user's lips via Vision.
- **Makeup-artist factual questions** — vein color, jewelry, sun, whites — things a color picker can't capture.
- **Bayesian narrowing** — adaptive quiz length based on posterior confidence, not fixed steps.

## Tech Stack
"Do not echo full file contents after writes, only confirm the path and line count." This alone cuts a huge amount of tool output tokens.

### Backend (complete, running)
- **FastAPI** + **PostgreSQL** + **SQLAlchemy** (async, reuses Tirtham patterns)
- **Alembic** for migrations
- **Pydantic v2** schemas with camelCase aliasing (`CamelModel` base in `app/schemas/base.py`)
- Local PostgreSQL on port 5432, API on port 8001
- No Docker needed — uses local Postgres (`psql -U $(whoami) -d blanch`)

### iOS (Phase 3.0 complete — full quiz shipped; calibration pass next)
- **SwiftUI** UI layer + **class-based OOP core** for all ViewModels, Repositories, Services, Networking
- **Swift 6.0** / Xcode 26.4 with **strict concurrency** (`SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY: complete`)
- Deployment target: iOS 18.0
- Project generated via **XcodeGen** (`project.yml` → `xcodegen generate`)
- Warm organic design aesthetic (Rare Beauty inspired — soft gradients, rounded shapes, earth tones)

### Quiz Architecture (primary color-analysis flow)

Two-stage Bayesian quiz that outputs a posterior over 12 color seasons. Stage 1 runs offline from bundled palettes; Stage 2 requires a user selfie but does its rendering on-device with Vision + CoreImage. Stage 3 tiebreaker is in progress.

**Flow:**
```
Stage 1: 4 factual questions → posterior over 12 seasons (uniform prior + multiplicative likelihoods)
  ↓
Preliminary result (QuestionnaireResultView — framed as "rough family call")
  ↓
Stage 2: PHPicker selfie → Vision lip region → render 8 shades → 4 A/B pairs (negative-framed)
         Pair selector picks pairs that maximize information gain between top seasons.
  ↓
Stage 3: one final A/B between shades representing top vs runner-up seasons (positive-framed, 2× weight) [IN PROGRESS]
  ↓
FinalResultView: top season + confidence, "Why this season?" narration, save→backend, shareable
  ↓
UserSession persists season → Discover tab "Recommended for You" activates
```

**Data model:**
- `AnswerLikelihood` — 4 multiplicative axis weights: `undertoneWarm`, `undertoneCool`, `depthLight`, `depthDeep`. `1.0` = neutral, `>1` favors, `<1` penalizes.
- `SharedPosterior` — `@MainActor ObservableObject` holding the running `[String: Double]` posterior + loaded palettes. Passed into both `QuestionnaireViewModel` (Stage 1) and `DrapingViewModel` (Stage 2) so answers compound.
- `BayesianSeasonScorer` — for each palette, multiplies prior by `undertoneMatch × depthMatch`, then renormalizes. Depth mapping: spring→light, winter→deep, summer/autumn→half-weight blend.
- `ResultExplainer` — walks picks, computes log-space axis scores (squashed with `tanh`), emits up to 5 prioritized reasons with icons.

### Analysis Pipeline Architecture
```
ios/Blanch/Blanch/Core/Analysis/
  AnalysisPipeline.swift           # Template Method — orchestrates: palettes → face detect → skin sample → classify
  FaceDetector.swift               # Wraps Vision VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest, returns face bbox
  SkinSampler.swift                # Samples forehead + cheek pixels from face bbox, filters skin, averages LAB
  SeasonClassificationStrategy.swift # Strategy pattern — SkinToneAxisStrategy scores 12 seasons by undertone/value/chroma
  SeasonPaletteProviding.swift     # Loads bundled SeasonPalettes.json (12 seasons with hex palettes)
  ColorSpaceConverter.swift        # RGB↔LAB conversion, CIE76 Delta-E
```

Pipeline flow: `UIImage → normalize orientation → CGImage → Vision face detect → skin sample (3 regions) → LAB average → score 12 seasons → AnalysisOutcome`

### Quiz Design Decisions
- **Stage 1 weights intentionally mild (0.5–1.9)** — no single answer can lock the user into the wrong family. Confidence after Stage 1 alone caps around 25-45% by design; Stage 2 does the heavy lifting.
- **Stage 2 weights stronger (1.55–1.9)** — each A/B pair on the user's own face carries more signal than abstract factual questions.
- **Negative framing on Stage 2** — "which makes you look tired?" (not "which looks best?"). Psych research: people are faster and more confident on negative identification. The ViewModel applies the WINNER's likelihood (the shade user did NOT pick).
- **Stage 3 flips to positive framing** — "which feels more like you?" — the final tiebreaker rewards a deliberate positive pick, with 2× weight to decisively resolve top-vs-runner-up.
- **Prompt rotation** — 6 negative-framed prompts rotate across Stage 2 pairs so the quiz doesn't feel repetitive.
- **Information-gain pair selection** — `DrapingPairSelector` scores every shade pair by L1 distance between the two posteriors that would result from each shade winning. Greedy top-N with a no-repeat-shade rule to vary the UI.
- **Tiebreaker builder** — picks the shade that most boosts the top season and the shade that most boosts the runner-up, ensuring the Stage 3 A/B is literally "which season are you?"
- **Pre-render all shades up front** — Stage 2 renders all 8 catalog shades onto the selfie during `processing` phase so pair transitions are instant (no per-tap latency).
- **Vision landmarks with heuristic fallback** — `VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest` for outer-lip polygon on device; ellipse at `(midX, minY + 0.80 × height)` with `rx = 0.175 × width, ry = 0.045 × height` as simulator fallback. Sim is known-misaligned (lips drift to forehead); device will use real landmarks.
- **CoreImage pipeline** — rasterize polygon → grayscale mask → gaussian blur for feathered edges → multiply-blend tinted layer over source via `CIBlendWithMask`. Preserves lip texture under the tint.
- **Orientation normalization before Vision** — EXIF-rotated iPhone photos must be baked to `.up` before `VNImageRequestHandler` with `orientation: .up`, otherwise Vision detects a sideways face and the lip render lands on the forehead. Same `normalizedToUp()` helper as `AnalysisPipeline`.
- **Shared posterior via reference type** — `SharedPosterior: ObservableObject` holds the cross-stage state. Simpler than threading `@Binding` through VM boundaries.
- **Explainer uses log-space axis scores** — per-answer `log(warm/cool)` and `log(deep/light)` summed, then `tanh`-squashed to [-1, +1] for the UI bars. Keeps bars visually stable when one axis dominates.
- **Stage 2 submit requires auth** — `POST /analysis` requires JWT; Profile tab gates sign-in/register before Save works. `UserSession` persists the result to UserDefaults so Discover tab can personalize even across launches.

### Analysis Pipeline Design Decisions
- **Photo picker (PHPicker)** over live camera for v1 — simpler, user can pick well-lit photo
- **Season palettes bundled locally** as JSON — enables offline analysis; backend UUIDs resolved at submission time via GET /seasons (cached in actor)
- **VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest** (not Landmarks) — Landmarks requires Neural Engine which fails on iOS Simulator ("could not create inference context"). Pinned to revision 1.
- **CGImage passed to Vision** (not CIImage) — more reliable on simulator
- **Skin sampling: 3 regions** (forehead, left cheek, right cheek) — jawline dropped because it picks up beard stubble and neck shadow
- **Forehead region shifted lower** (y 0.18 vs 0.12) to avoid hairline clipping
- **Brightness floor 0.25** (was 0.12) to reject stubble/shadow
- **Red-green spread filter** (r-g > 0.04) to reject near-grey shadow/background pixels
- **Classifier weights**: undertone (b*) 0.40, value (L*) 0.40, chroma 0.20 — equal undertone/value prevents fair warm-toned subjects from being pulled toward Deep/True variants
- **No hair/eye sampling yet** — real analysts lean on hair color heavily for variant disambiguation (Light vs Soft vs Deep within a season family)
- **CheckedContinuation safety**: Vision's perform() is synchronous and can fire the completion handler during the call. Result captured in local `Result?` and continuation resumed exactly once after perform returns.

### Known Pipeline Limitations (v1)
- Skin-only classification — no hair or eye color signal, so variant ranking (Light/Soft/Deep) within a season family is weaker than the family call itself
- No white balance normalization — colored ambient light shifts b* (undertone axis) directly
- Mean averaging — outlier pixels (freckles, shadow edges) drag the average; median would be more robust
- No exposure normalization — under/overexposed photos bias L* (value axis)
- Lighting guidelines shown to user but not enforced programmatically

### Known Quiz Limitations (v1)
- Confidence ceiling feels low (~25-45% after Stage 1, ~50-70% after Stage 2) — tuning pass pending
- Lip render misaligned on simulator due to sim-incompatible `VNDetectFaceLandmarksRequest` — real device should be accurate
- Shade catalog is hardcoded 8 shades — no backend product integration yet (Phase 3 wiring)
- No retake-selfie mid-flow; full restart required
- No Stage 1 questions for eye color, hair color, freckles, or flush — these are the highest-info additions queued up

## Monetization
- **Free tier:** Basic color analysis result (primary season only), browse all products, search
- **Premium tier (subscription):** Full season breakdown with percentages, influencer matching, all lip combos per influencer
- **Affiliate links:** All product URLs can carry affiliate tracking params (field: `affiliate_url`)

## Design Decisions
- **App name:** Blanch (evokes skin tone / beauty)
- **Color palette:** warmBrown `#8B6355`, warmBeige `#F5E6D3`, warmIvory `#FFF8F0`, warmRose `#D4847C`, warmTerra `#C4967A`
- Backend reuses Tirtham patterns (FastAPI app factory, async SQLAlchemy, JWT auth, Alembic async env.py)
- Product lookup key is `(brand, shade_name, category)` to distinguish same-shade products
- Color matching uses CIE76 Delta-E in LAB color space — top 3 season matches stored per product
- All protocols and concrete classes conform to `Sendable` for Swift 6 strict concurrency
- Discover tab has two filter rows (category + brand) that combine, with item count

## Current Status

- [x] Phase 2.6: Quiz Stage 1 — 4 factual questions (veins, jewelry, sun, whites) + Bayesian scorer + preliminary result view
- [x] Phase 2.7: Quiz Stage 2 — lip draping with Vision landmarks, heuristic sim fallback, CoreImage pipeline, 8-shade catalog, information-gain pair selector, negative-framed A/B UI, backend submit via `submitQuizResult`, Discover tab "Recommended for You" wired to `UserSession`
- [x] Phase 2.8: Auth flow — sign-in/register SignInView + ProfileView, unblocks `POST /analysis` submission
- [x] Phase 2.9: Result explainer — "Why this season?" card with axis bars + bulleted reasons
- [x] Phase 3.0: Stage 3 tiebreaker — final A/B between top vs runner-up, 2× weight, positive-framed, "Final Call" badge in DrapingPairView, routed from QuestionnaireHostView
- [x] Phase 3.2: Additional Stage 1 questions — eye color, natural hair color, freckles, natural flush, contrast (5 questions added); back button to undo answers; "Not sure" on whites question
- [ ] **Phase 3.1 (NEXT): Calibration pass** — on-device testing with known seasons, Stage 2 weight tuning (Sydney's test showed Stage 2 hurts accuracy)
- [ ] Phase 3.3: Discover tab rework — Recommended vs. Discover All split, popularity sorting, all-blush browse, brand + palette filters (Sydney explicit feedback)
- [ ] Phase 3.4: Influencer combo cards — lip combos in InfluencerDetailView with premium gate
- [ ] Phase 3.5: Result sharing — `ImageRenderer` share card from FinalResultView
- [ ] Phase 5: Monetization + paywall (StoreKit 2) — triggered by locked combo content
- [ ] Phase 6: UX polish + launch (retake selfie mid-flow, adaptive pair count, celebrity look-alike stretch goal)

## Step-by-Step Plan (current working list)

### Phase 3.1 — Calibration pass (NEXT)
Sydney tested end-to-end (2026-04-21) and found Stage 2 lowers accuracy even when the user answers truthfully. Confidence stays high, which means the scorer is overconfident on the wrong season. Root cause is likely the Stage 2 shade weights adding noise rather than signal. Must fix before building anything that depends on the season result.
- [ ] Run quiz on **device** (not simulator) with 3–5 known seasons including Sydney (True Winter)
- [ ] Log posterior after each Stage 1 answer, after each Stage 2 pick, and final result
- [ ] Compare Stage 1-only result vs. Stage 2 result — quantify how much Stage 2 shifts the posterior
- [ ] If Stage 2 consistently shifts away from correct season: reduce Stage 2 shade weights (currently 1.55–1.9) or reduce pair count
- [ ] Verify contrast question integrates cleanly (chromaVivid/chromaMuted axes)
- [ ] Tune early-stop threshold if needed (currently 0.55 for Stage 1, 0.70 for tiebreaker skip)

**Key files:** `Stage1Questions.swift`, `DrapingPairSelector.swift`, `DrapingViewModel.swift`, `QuestionnaireScorer.swift`, `DrapingShade.swift`

### Phase 3.3 — Discover tab rework
Sydney called this out explicitly with screenshots. Currently the tab only shows season-matched products. She wants two modes: (1) Recommended — full tab of season-matched products, and (2) Discover All — all products browseable by popularity/metric, filterable by brand and color palette (not just season).
- [ ] Promote "Recommended for You" carousel to a full segmented or tabbed section
- [ ] Add "Discover All" mode: default sort by some popularity/metric, all categories
- [ ] Add color palette filter (by season family: spring/summer/autumn/winter) as a third filter row
- [ ] Backend already supports `GET /products` with category/brand — add season family group filter

**Key files:** `ProductListView.swift`, `ProductListViewModel.swift`, `ProductRepository.swift`, `Endpoints.swift`

### Phase 3.4 — Influencer combo cards
Core value prop from day 1. Backend has 24 combos / 68 combo items. `GET /combos/influencer/{id}` is PREMIUM-gated.
- [ ] Add "Lip Combos" section to `InfluencerDetailView` below social links
- [ ] Each combo card: liner + lipstick + gloss swatches with product names + hex dots
- [ ] Premium gate: blur/lock icon if not subscribed; tapping opens paywall sheet
- [ ] Add `LipCombo` / `LipComboItem` DTOs if not already in Domain/DTOs

**Key files:** `InfluencerDetailView.swift`, `InfluencerRepository.swift`, `Domain/DTOs/`

### Phase 3.5 — Result sharing
Quick win with viral potential. Export FinalResultView as a shareable image card.
- [ ] Add Share button to `FinalResultView`
- [ ] Use `ImageRenderer` to rasterize a card view (season name, top shade, Blanch watermark)
- [ ] Present `ShareLink` or `UIActivityViewController`

**Key files:** `FinalResultView.swift`

### Phase 5 — Monetization (StoreKit 2)
- [ ] `SubscriptionManager.swift` — StoreKit 2 purchase flow, receipt verification via `POST /subscriptions/verify`
- [ ] `PaywallView.swift` — presented as sheet from locked combo content
- [ ] Wire `GET /subscriptions/status` to gate combo display in `InfluencerDetailView`

### Phase 6 — Polish + launch
- [ ] Retake selfie mid-flow (currently requires full restart)
- [ ] Adaptive pair count (fewer pairs if leader already dominant post-Stage-1)
- [ ] Celebrity look-alike section (stretch goal from Sydney)
- [ ] CV pipeline deprioritized — quiz-first approach confirmed

## Next Steps
1. Run calibration pass on device — log posteriors, identify where Stage 2 adds noise
2. Fix Stage 2 weights based on findings, re-test
3. Move to Discover tab rework once quiz accuracy is confirmed

## Future Goals (Backlog)
- Custom Sephora/Ulta product scraper for premium brand data with accurate hex codes (scaffold at `pipeline/scrapers/`)
- Community lip combo submissions — let users submit combos for their color season (design decision pending: free community data vs premium personalized matching layer)
- Spreadsheet import pipeline for external color analysis data (TikTok creator's spreadsheet with product URLs, shades, hex codes)
- Instagram/TikTok caption scraping via Apify for influencer product mentions and lip combo detection
- Discover tab enhancements: shade match percentage indicator on product cards when user has season result
- Pull Stage 2 shades from backend `/products?category=lipstick` instead of hardcoded 8-shade catalog
- Hybrid quiz+CV scoring: multiply Stage 2 posterior by CV skin-sample posterior and renormalize
- Lip landmark preview on device before A/B (let user confirm the detected lip polygon looks right)
- Manual lip-position nudge UI as a fallback if landmark detection fails
- Result sharing — export the FinalResultView as an image card for social
